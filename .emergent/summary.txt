The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and progressed the development of a Power BI report directory application. The work began with clarifying product requirements, including the desired visual and functional aspects of the directory, and the initial data source. The engineer adeptly handled an inaccessible SharePoint link by requesting direct data, which the user promptly provided (43 reports across 7 groups).

The development followed an iterative approach: first, setting up the core React frontend and FastAPI backend with initial report display, then refining the UI based on user feedback (removing unnecessary elements, compacting layout). Subsequently, the engineer implemented a comprehensive administration interface for managing reports (add, edit, delete), and integrated a direct link to Power BI usage metrics, fulfilling a critical user request. The work concluded with the user providing final refinements concerning admin password protection, report grouping by area, and company logo placement. The AI engineer consistently confirmed understanding and sought user validation before proceeding, demonstrating effective communication and problem-solving within the given constraints.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build a professional, visual, and user-friendly directory for Power BI reports, enabling easy navigation between them. The application should provide a centralized access point for existing Power BI reports.

Initial requirements:
*   **Directory with Links:** Display Power BI reports with clickable links that open the reports in Power BI.
*   **Visual Navigation:** A pleasant and professional visual interface for browsing reports.
*   **Report Details:** Display only the report title.
*   **Categories/Workspaces:** Organize reports by categories, specifically áreas de trabajo (workspaces).
*   **Thumbnails:** Include mini-thumbnails for reports (though this was later refined/removed visually).
*   **Public Reports:** All reports are publicly accessible; no authentication is needed for viewing.
*   **Data Source:** User initially provided a SharePoint Excel template for metadata, which was inaccessible. Subsequently, the user provided a direct list of 43 reports with names, groups, and Power BI URLs.

UI refinements after initial build:
*   Remove yellow dot preview (Power BI icon/thumbnail).
*   Remove Abrir informe (Open report) text.
*   Replace with a subtle arrow icon next to the report name, animating on hover.
*   Adopt a more compact design with smaller cards and less padding.
*   Increase the number of columns to display more reports per row (up to 5 on large screens).

New Features (Administration & Metrics):
*   **Administration Interface:** A web-based interface to add, edit, and delete reports.
    *   Form for adding new reports with Power BI URL validation and existing group selection.
    *   Inline editing and deletion for existing reports.
    *   Management of groups/workspaces, including creation of new groups and viewing group statistics.
*   **Power BI Usage Metrics Button:** A direct link to Power BI usage metrics ().

Final Retouches Requested:
*   Add password protection () to the administration button.
*   Group reports by their grupo (area/category) while maintaining alphabetical order within each group.
*   Place the company logo, centered, at the top of the page.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Environment Variables:** Strict usage of  for frontend API calls and  for backend DB access. No hardcoding of URLs/ports.
-   **API Routing:** Backend routes prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress.
-   **UI Framework:** Tailwind CSS for styling, focusing on professional and responsive design.
-   **Service Management:** Supervisor for managing frontend (port 3000) and backend (port 8001) processes.
-   **Data Handling:** Initial data ingestion from user-provided text, stored in MongoDB.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, interacting with a MongoDB database.



-   **/app/backend/server.py:**
    *   **Summary:** This is the core of the FastAPI backend application. It handles API routes, database interactions (MongoDB), and serves the data for Power BI reports.
    *   **Changes Made:**
        *   **Initial:** Setup a  endpoint to fetch a hardcoded list of Power BI reports (derived from the user's provided list). It includes fields like uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), , , , , .
        *   **Refinement:** Expanded to include administrative endpoints (, ) for managing reports and groups (add, update, delete). Implemented data validation for new/updated reports and error handling.
        *   **Database Integration:** Connects to MongoDB using  to persist report and group data. Uses  for report IDs instead of Mongo's ObjectID for JSON serialization compatibility.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js:**
    *   **Summary:** The main React component rendering the Power BI report directory and its interactive elements.
    *   **Changes Made:**
        *   **Initial:** Rendered a grid or list of report cards, each displaying the report name and linking to its Power BI URL. Initial UI included a Power BI icon and Abrir informe text.
        *   **UI Refinement:** Modified to remove the Power BI icon and Abrir informe text. Introduced a subtle arrow icon next to the report name that animates on hover. Adjusted Tailwind CSS classes for a more compact layout, smaller cards, reduced padding, and increased the number of columns for reports per row (up to 5).
        *   **New Features:** Added two new buttons: Métricas de Uso (Usage Metrics) which links directly to the provided Power BI metrics URL, and Administrar (Admin) which opens a modal for administration.
        *   **Admin Modal:** Implemented the admin modal with three tabs: Agregar Informe (Add Report) with a form, Gestionar Informes (Manage Reports) with a list of reports supporting inline editing and deletion, and Grupos (Groups) for group management. Frontend validations for forms were added.
        *   **API Calls:** Integrated API calls to the backend (, ) to fetch, add, update, and delete reports and groups.

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css:**
    *   **Summary:** Contains custom CSS rules and Tailwind CSS directives for global and component-specific styling.
    *   **Changes Made:** Primarily used for setting up Tailwind CSS base styles and potentially for custom animations or fine-tuning the layout that couldn't be achieved directly with Tailwind utility classes. Modifications would align with the UI refinements in  to achieve the desired compact and professional look.

-   **/app/test_result.md:**
    *   **Summary:** Used to record testing protocols and results.
    *   **Changes Made:** Updated by the AI engineer after the initial bulk file write to reflect the status of backend testing. It's a critical communication point with the testing sub-agent and for internal record-keeping.

<current_work>
The application currently functions as a visually improved directory for Power BI reports. The core directory displays reports in a compact, organized manner, allowing users to navigate to reports via clickable names with subtle arrow indicators.

The significant new additions are:
1.  **Métricas de Uso Button:** A green button provides direct access to the user's Power BI usage metrics URL.
2.  **Administrar Button:** A purple button opens a comprehensive administration modal, which includes:
    *   **Agregar Informe Tab:** A form allowing users to add new Power BI reports by providing their name, selecting an existing group, and entering the Power BI URL. Real-time validations are in place.
    *   **Gestionar Informes Tab:** Displays a list of all existing reports, enabling inline editing of report details and deletion with a confirmation prompt. Changes are reflected in real-time.
    *   **Grupos Tab:** Provides functionality to create new groups/areas of work and displays statistics related to existing groups.

The backend has been enhanced with new  endpoints to support these administration functionalities, including robust validations and error handling, and preventing duplicate entries. The application is now in a state where reports can be managed dynamically through a web interface, and usage metrics are easily accessible. The overall design has been optimized for screen space.
